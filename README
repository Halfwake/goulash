//To create a text parser for a goulash bot is easy.

func main() {
	myBot := goulash.New("irc.freenode.net", "#go-nuts", "goulashBot") //Intializes a bot with a server, channel, and nick name.
	bot.OnStart = func(bot *BaseBot) {fmt.Println("Starting!")} //Assigns an optional startup function
	bot.Response = func(bot *BaseBot, text string) {bot.Quit()} //Assigns a mandatory run function
	bot.Run() //Starts the bot and auto connects if 'OnStart' doesn't connect on its own or 'OnStart' has now been assigned.
